    "The Script uses the *World_Age_2019.csv* and *AgeSpecificFertility.csv* -built using the *AgeDistribution_FertilityAgeDistribution.ipynp* script- dataset in order to get the age distribution for each country of interest and then uses it as well as additional data on the country-specific household composition to build the household structure for all the countries of interest.  \n",

    "The process of sampling households comprhends two following steps: \n",
    "- Use the distribution of household structures to draw a type of household (e.g. single person, coulple, nuclear family, multigenerational family;\n",
    "- Sample the age of the individual agents according to their role in the household (e.g. parendt, child, grandparent) combined with information about the age distribution of the population stored in World_Age_2019.csv file\n",

    "The Script comprehends country-specific functions **sample_households_country(n)** which, given an input of population size *n* outputs the household composition for that country population. "
